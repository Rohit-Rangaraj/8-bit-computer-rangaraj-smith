## Project Overview

This project is aimed at designing an 8-bit processor from scratch to explore computer architecture concepts. The processor will then be integrated with a machine learning accelerator to deploy state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models.

## Educational Value Added

This project will enable us learn about the following concepts:

<ul>
<li> Custom Processor Design Principles
<li> Basics of Digital Design
<li> PCB Fabrication
<li> In-built AI Accelerator Design
</ul>
